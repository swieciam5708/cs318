<h3> How can I find out more about Girl Scout camps in my area?</h3>
<p class="answer"> Call your local Girl Scout council and ask for a copy of the day or resident camp information. If you want to attend a camp program and your council doesn't offer one, ask for the name of another council in the area or look up the councils in your state. Most councils allow participants from other areas to attend their camps

<h3> Why are Girl Scout cookies only available for a short time?</h3>  
<p class="answer">The Girl Scout Cookie Program is the premier entrepreneurship opportunity for girls, but it is just one part of the Girl Scout Leadership Experience. Girl Scouts participate in many activities throughout the year and work on many projects. The cookie sale is just one of those activities. And because only girls may sell Girl Scout Cookies, their market availability is normally limited to the six- to eight-week period when they are engaged in the program in their local council.

<h3> Are Girl Scout cookies Kosher?</h3>
<p class="answer"> Yes. All Girl Scout Cookies are kosher. For more information about cookie ingredients, please see Meet the Cookies, or visit our bakersâ€™ websites: ABC Bakers and Little Brownie Bakers.
